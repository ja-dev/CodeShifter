The National Security Agney (NSA) holds a CodeBreaker Challenge each year. Participants from across the world get to reverse engineering and "break" software during tasks in the challenge.   This year (2016), there were 6 tasks. This program was coded to solve tasks of the challenge. You can modify parameters according to variables used in your binaries.

    After all, I made this program just to "get things done",
    and not for demonstration of efficient coding ;)*/


    You'll need to copy the binaries and key files to the application start-up directory before you can use it.
    I've included the private/public keys that were present in my binaries. I'm not sure if NSA used the same keys
	for every one else's binaries. But, in case they did, you can simply use the ones I've provided.
    Note that you'll HAVE TO COMPILE/RUN in 32 bits ONLY! Something goes wrong in the brute-force procedure when you do it otherwise (atleast on Windows 10).
    	I haven't figured out what it is yet, and I don't intend to do so. If you do figure it out, do let me know!

    Again, I'd love to heard from you!
